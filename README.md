## Description
Mr.White and Jesse seem to be in an awful hurry to hide their flour
in a whole in the middle of the desert. "How strange" you think to
yourself before Mr.White notices you staring and demands you help.
Now you must scurry up some sand to help them cover their
flour- while also having the task of not getting caught by this
police dog.

## Bonus
This project was created in a short amount of time,
and even if I'm not 100% satisfied by it and can imagine
few way of improving it. I'm happy by how it looks.

The overall pixel aesthetic and plot idea is nice.
It's the first thing in the class that I've created that's
not a total eye sore. It's something I wouldn't be
ashamed to show classmates.
