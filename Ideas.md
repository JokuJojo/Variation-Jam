Premise:

I want a sort of Dora meets Breaking bad game,
where the use helps the duo (Walkter White and Jesse Pinkman)
to hide meth from the suspicious cops

The user must reload on sand and then drop the sand
on the meth to hide it. They must do this without getting caught
which is indicated by the question mark on the side.

If they get caught, they immediately lose. 
If they manage to fill up the hole with sand
they win.

Aesthetics:
1. A menu Screen
2. Speech bubbles for Walkter white and Jesse
3. The overall map aesthetic
4. Pixelated


Js:
1. Creating sand to fall 
2. Having a reloading system with clicking
4. A random timer for everytime the cop comes out with a warning
5. Having to make the hole interactable
