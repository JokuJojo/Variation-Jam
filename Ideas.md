Premise:

I want a sort of Dora meets Breaking bad game,
where the use helps the duo (Walkter White and Jesse Pinkman)
to hide meth from the suspicious cops

The user must reload on sand and then drop the sand
on the meth to hide it. They must do this without getting caught
which is indicated by the question mark on the side.

If they get caught, they immediately lose. 
If they manage to fill up the hole with sand
they win.

Aesthetics:
1. A menu Screen
2. Speech bubbles for Walkter white and Jesse
3. The overall map aesthetic
4. Pixelated


Js:
1. Creating sand to fall 
2. Having a reloading system with clicking
4. A random timer for everytime the cop comes out with a warning
5. Having to make the hole interactable


My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. To all law enforcement entities, this is not an admission of guilt. I am speaking to my family now. Skyler, you are the love of my life. I hope you know that. Walter Junior, you're my big man. There are going to be some...things. Things that you'll come to learn about me in the next few days. I just want you to know that, no matter how it may look, I only had you in my heart. Goodbye.
